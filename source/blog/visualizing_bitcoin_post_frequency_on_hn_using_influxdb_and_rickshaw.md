title: Visualizing Bitcoin post frequency on HN with InfluxDB and Rickshaw

Based on casual observation, the crowd at HackerNews seems to be totally obsessed 
with bitcoin and it seems to be reaching a fever pitch. What better way to 
look at the HN bitcoin obsession than with a visualization? In this post we'll 
use InfluxDB and Rickshaw to create a visualization of the number of posts with 
bitcoin in the title on HN.

InfluxDB has a straightforward and snappy HTTP API that makes it easy to
pull your time series data out in real-time for use in user interfaces and
visualizations. This makes it a great pairing with [D3](http://d3js.org),
a data visualization library written in JavaScript.

First, we need to load InfluxDB with the data of bitcoin posts over time. We'll use an 
open [Hacker News API](https://www.hnsearch.com/api) to get a list of the last 1,000 
posts containing the phrase `bitcoin` in the title. Here's a quick ruby script that 
also leverages the InfluxDB rubygem for writing data into the database:

```ruby
require "rubygems"
require "net/http"
require "net/https"
require "uri"
require "json"
require "time"
require "influxdb"

QUERY = "bitcoin"

http = Net::HTTP.new("api.thriftdb.com", 443)
http.use_ssl = true

influxdb = InfluxDB::Client.new "bitcoin", {
  :host => "sandbox.influxdb.org",
  :port => 9061,
  :username => "todd",
  :password => "password"
}

(0..9).each do |count|
  params = {
    "q" => QUERY,
    "start" => 100*count,
    "limit" => 100,
    "sortby" => "create_ts desc",
    "weights[title]" => "1.0",
  }

  request = Net::HTTP::Get.new "/api.hnsearch.com/items/_search?" +
    URI.encode_www_form(params)
  response = http.request(request)
  data = JSON.parse(response.body)

  data["results"].each do |result|
    influxdb.write_point("posts", {
      :message => result["item"]["title"],
      :time => Time.parse(result["item"]["create_ts"]).to_i * 1000
    })
  end
end
```

If you don't have a local installation of InfluxDB handy, head on over
to our [InfluxDB Playground](http://play.influxdb.org) and create a free
database to experiment with. Once we have our data available, we can turn to the fun part - visualization.
To make things easier, we're going to use a wrapper for D3
called [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/), which was written
by the gang over at Shutterstock.

We'll just use the [InfluxDB Javascript Library](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb-js)
to fetch the data, and then feed that right into a simple line chart in Rickshaw.

```javascript
$(function() {
  var influxdb = new InfluxDB("sandbox.influxdb.org", 9061, "todd", "password", "bitcoin");

  influxdb.query("SELECT COUNT(message) FROM posts WHERE time > now() - 365d GROUP BY time(24h);", function(points) {
    var data = points.map(function(point) {
      return {
        x: Math.floor(point.time / 1000),
        y: point.count
      };
    }).reverse();

    var graph = new Rickshaw.Graph({
      element: document.querySelector("#chart"),
      width: 640,
      height: 240,
      renderer: 'line',
      series: [{ data: data, color: 'steelblue' }]
    });

    var xAxis = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time({ graph: graph });
    var yAxis = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Y({ graph: graph });

    xAxis.render();
    yAxis.render();
    graph.render();
  });
});
```

Since InfluxDB lets us easily query the time series data, all we need is a simple
transformation and then it's ready to feed directly into Rickshaw.

You can view, run, and modify the entire thing on this JSFiddle:

Looking at the frequency over time it definitely seems to be picking up along with Bitcoin's price.
