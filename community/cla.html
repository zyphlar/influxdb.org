You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.</p><p>For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:</p><ul><li><a target="blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/">Django's excellent CLA FAQ</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://producingoss.com/en/copyright-assignment.html">A well-written chapter from Karl Fogel's Producing Open Source Software on CLAs</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_license_agreement">The Wikipedia article on CLAs</a></li></ul><p>This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.</p><p>If you have more questions, shoot us an email or drop by #influxdb on IRC.</p><p><i>Many thanks to <a target="blank" href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> for permission to re-use their CLA!</i></p><hr /><h2>Terms of the Agreement</h2><p>This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Errplane, Inc. dba InfluxDB, a Delaware corporation (“InfluxDB,” “we” or “us” etc.) and you (as defined and further identified below).
